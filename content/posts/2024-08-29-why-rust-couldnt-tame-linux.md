Imagine you're standing on the deck of a sinking ship—let's call it the *SS Rust-for-Linux*. Everyone aboard, particularly the true believers, keeps insisting that the ship is unsinkable. After all, Rust is the apex predator of programming languages, evolved over 50 years of computational history. And yet, here we are, watching as one of the chief engineers, [Wedson, jumps ship, waving a goodbye](https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20240828211117.9422-1-wedsonaf@gmail.com/) that speaks louder than any speech could. The problems, they suggest, are as insurmountable as Everest on a winter's day, and anyone with a shred of sense can see that this grand venture is more a waste of time than a path to glory.

Now, if you've been keeping your ear to the ground, or more aptly, scrolling through the digital pub crawl that is Hacker News or Lobsters, you've probably seen the writing on the wall. The Rust community, despite its collective brainpower, lacks the one thing necessary to turn this endeavor into anything but a disaster: a functional mechanism to actually make it work. It's a hard pill to swallow, but sometimes you have to recognize when you're swimming against the tide.

Wedson, for their part, doesn't give us the gory details, but the clues are there if you know where to look. They cite some less-than-inspiring encounters with the old guard of filesystem maintainers—imagine trying to sell them a new religion when they've already got one. Their response? Rust, they say, is a religion in itself, and not one they're looking to convert to. Wedson probably hoped for a miracle, some deus ex machina where someone with enough clout would step in and make the old dogs sit down, shut up, and let the Rust evangelists work their magic. But when the harsh reality hits, it hits hard.

But this isn't just any project—it's one of monumental scale and complexity, where even the smallest misstep can lead to catastrophic consequences. Without that deus ex machina, the obstacles raised by the filesystem maintainers aren't merely technical concerns; they're existential challenges. When you're dealing with a system that underpins the very infrastructure of the digital world, every line of code, every architectural decision, is a potential landmine. It's not just about innovation; it's about stability, reliability, and an almost fanatical adherence to principles that have been battle-tested over decades. In this kind of environment, introducing Rust isn't just a technical challenge—it's a challenge to the very ethos that has kept these systems running smoothly for so long.

This is where cognitive dissonance comes into play. On the Internet, it's easy to live in an echo chamber where Rust is the answer to everything, and the chorus of agreement drowns out any dissent. But out here in the real world, when that dissonance finally cracks the bubble, it's brutal. **It's not Wedson's fault. The Rust-for-Linux pioneers have done phenomenal work.** But avoiding the hard conversations, the ones buried in the technical weeds where it really matters—those are the conversations that decide whether your software gets to run the systems that hold up the modern world.

The filesystem maintainers call Rust a religion because, well, it is one. Ask any Rust zealot when they should use another language, and you'll see them squirm. They won't give you a straight answer because they can't. Rust, in their eyes, is the endgame, the final answer to every problem. Sure, some will claim otherwise, but push them on specifics and you'll find that they've got nothing. Or worse, they'll give you some half-hearted excuse about external pressures forcing them to work in another language. If these Rust fanatics were in charge, we'd still be bogged down in endless debates on GitHub, forever deliberating while the rest of the world moves on.

So, here we are, watching the *SS Rust-for-Linux* list to one side, taking on water, and wondering if anyone will ever admit that maybe, just maybe, this wasn't the right ship to board in the first place.
